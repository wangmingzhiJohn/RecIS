[中文版](README_zh.md)

RecIS: A unified deep learning framework specifically designed for ultra-large-scale sparse and dense computing. Built on the PyTorch open-source ecosystem, it provides a complete solution for recommendation model training and recommendation combined with multimodal/large model training. Jointly launched by Alibaba's AiCheng Technology and Taobao & Tmall's Advertising Technology and Algorithm Technology teams. Currently widely applied in Alibaba's advertising, recommendation, and search scenarios.

</div>

- **ColumnIO**: Data Reading
  - Supports distributed sharded data reading
  - Supports feature pre-computation during the reading phase
  - Assembles samples into Torch Tensors and provides data prefetching
  
- **Feature Engine**: Feature Processing
  - Provides feature engineering and feature transformation processing capabilities, including Hash / Mod / Bucketize, etc.
  - Supports automatic operator fusion optimization strategies
  
- **Embedding Engine**: Embedding Management and Computation
  - Provides conflict-free, scalable KV storage embedding tables
  - Offers multi-table fusion optimization capabilities for better memory access performance
  - Supports feature admission and filtering strategies
  
- **Saver**: Parameter Saving and Loading
  - Provides sparse parameter storage and delivery capabilities in SafeTensors standard format

- **Pipelines**: Training Process Orchestration
  - Connects the above components and encapsulates training workflows
  - Supports complex training processes including multi-stage (training/testing alternation) and multi-objective computation

## 🚀 Key Optimizations

### Efficient Dynamic Embedding

The RecIS framework implements efficient dynamic embeddings (HashTable) through a two-level storage architecture:

- **IDMap**: Serves as first-level storage, using feature IDs as keys and Offsets as values
- **EmbeddingBlocks**: 
  - Serves as second-level storage, continuous sharded memory blocks for storing embedding parameters and optimizer states
  - Supports dynamic sharding with flexible scalability
- **Flexible Hardware Adaptation Strategy**: Supports both GPU and CPU placement for IDMap and EmbeddingBlocks

### Distributed Optimization

- **Parameter Aggregation and Sharding**: 
  - During model creation, merges parameter tables with identical properties (dimensions, initializers, etc.) into a single logical table
  - Parameters are evenly distributed across compute nodes
- **Request Merging and Splitting**: 
  - During forward computation, merges requests for parameter tables with identical properties and deduplicates to compute sharding information
  - Obtains embedding vectors from various compute nodes through All-to-All collective communication

### Efficient Hardware Resource Utilization

- **GPU Concurrency Optimization**: 
  - Supports feature processing operator fusion optimization, significantly reducing operator count and launch overhead
  
- **Parameter Table Fusion Optimization**: 
  - Supports merging parameter tables with identical properties, reducing feature lookup frequency, significantly decreasing operator count, and improving memory space utilization efficiency

- **Operator Implementation Optimization**: 
  - Implements vectorized memory access in operators to improve memory access utilization
  - Optimizes reduction operators through warp-level merging, reducing atomic operations and improving memory access utilization
