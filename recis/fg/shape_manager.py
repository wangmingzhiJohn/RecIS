class ShapeManager:
    """Shape manager for inferring and managing feature and block dimensions.

    The ShapeManager class is responsible for automatically inferring the shapes
    of features and blocks based on their configurations, and providing utilities
    to manage shape contexts for different processing stages. It handles various
    embedding transformation types and ensures proper shape compatibility for
    feature concatenation within blocks.

    Key Features:
        - Automatic shape inference for features and blocks
        - Support for sequence features with variable lengths
        - Multi-hash embedding shape calculation
        - Shape context management for different processing stages
        - Shape compatibility validation for block concatenation

    Attributes:
        fg_parser: Feature generation parser instance.
        feature_shape (dict): Dictionary mapping feature names to their shapes.
        block_shape (dict): Dictionary mapping block names to their shapes.
        shape_context (dict): Dictionary storing shape contexts for different stages.
