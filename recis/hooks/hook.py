class Hook:
    """Base class for all hooks in the RecIS training system.

    Hooks provide a way to extend the training process by defining callback methods
    that are called at specific points during training, evaluation, and execution.
    All custom hooks should inherit from this base class and override the relevant
    callback methods.

    The hook system supports the following callback points:
    - Training lifecycle: before_train, after_train
    - Evaluation lifecycle: before_evaluate, after_evaluate
    - Epoch lifecycle: before_epoch, after_epoch
    - Step lifecycle: before_step, after_step
    - Cleanup: end

    Example:
        Creating a custom hook:

        >>> class CustomHook(Hook):
        ...     def __init__(self, custom_param):
        ...         self.custom_param = custom_param
        ...
        ...     def before_train(self):
        ...         print(f"Training started with {self.custom_param}")
        ...
        ...     def after_step(self):
        ...         # Custom logic after each training step
        ...         pass
        >>> # Use the custom hook
        >>> custom_hook = CustomHook("my_parameter")
        >>> trainer.add_hook(custom_hook)
